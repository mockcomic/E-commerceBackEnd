# Week 13 Challenge - E-commerce Back End

## Description

This application facilitates interaction with a database using express routes. It serves as a back end solution for an e-commerce website, leveraging the latest technologies to provide a competitive edge.

## User Story

As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a functional Express.js API:

- **Environment Variables:** When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
- **Schema and Seed Commands:** When I enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
- **Server Startup:** When I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
- **API GET routes:** When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
- **API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes:** When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
